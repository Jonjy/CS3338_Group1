\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document outlines the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the LA City Sidewalk Assessment Project. It specifies the requirements for the system which aims to assess sidewalk conditions in Los Angeles and enable users to report and visualize sidewalk issues.

\subsection{Scope}
The system will allow users (residents and community workers) to submit sidewalk assessment reports and view visualized data on sidewalk conditions. The goal is to improve urban infrastructure and streamline sidewalk maintenance and repair tasks.

\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product Perspective}
The LA City Sidewalk Assessment system is a web-based application for reporting and visualizing sidewalk conditions. It is designed to work with existing GIS systems and provide both individual and collective insights into sidewalk conditions.

\subsection{Product Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sidewalk Assessment Form}: A form for submitting sidewalk condition reports, including an option to upload media.
    \item \textbf{Interactive Map}: A map showing sidewalk assessment data.
    \item \textbf{Search Functionality}: Users can search specific locations and view sidewalk reports.
    \item \textbf{Data Analytics}: The system will offer analytics based on user-submitted data for better decision-making.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Classes and Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Residents}: Can submit sidewalk assessments and view reports.
    \item \textbf{Community Workers}: Can view submitted data and prioritize repairs.
    \item \textbf{Admin Users}: Manage user data, edit sidewalk assessments, and handle system configuration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operating Environment}
The system will be deployed as a web application and will work on major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. It will be hosted on a cloud platform and access will be available via HTTPS.
