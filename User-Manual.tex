\section{Objective}

\paragraph{The BOE Sidewalk Assessment System is a project that aims to record and assess vertical and horizontal
displacement of sidewalks throughout the city of Los Angeles. The Bureau of Engineering and students
from Cal State La have partnered up for this project. This document will discuss what we plan on doing
for this project.}

\section{Why is this needed?}

\paragraph{The purpose of this document is to give a general overview of the software and the requirements that
need to be done for the project. The project has been worked on over a course of several years, and this
document will primarily focus on the three tasks on hand, calculation of horizontal and vertical
displacement, avoidance collision, as well as performing various field tests for testing.}
